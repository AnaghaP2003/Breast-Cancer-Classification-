Breast Cancer Classification: Logistic Regression vs. Neural Networks

Project Overview
This project uses two models for classifying breast cancer tumors (Benign or Malignant):

  - Logistic Regression: A simpler and interpretable machine learning algorithm.
  - Neural Network (Deep Learning): A more complex model using Keras and TensorFlow with better generalization capacity.

Both models are evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to compare their performance.

Why This Project is Useful?

Early and accurate classification of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment. The project explores how machine learning and deep learning techniques can be employed to build models that help in this classification task.

  - Logistic Regression: Provides an interpretable model with reasonable accuracy.
  - Neural Network: More sophisticated, leading to better accuracy in predicting whether tumors are malignant or benign.
    
Model Accuracy

  - Logistic Regression Accuracy: 97.37%
  - Neural Network Accuracy: 96.49%
    
How to Get Started?

- Clone the Repository: Download the code and ensure the required Python libraries are installed.
  
- Run the Code: Execute the code in any Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

- Evaluate Performance: 
After running both models, the Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of 97.37%, while the Neural Network reaches 96.49%. Visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and confusion matrices are included to aid in data exploration and model evaluation.

- Feature Selection: The project also incorporates feature selection using Random Forests to identify the most important features for classification.
